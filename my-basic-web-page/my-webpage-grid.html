                    Manchester is a city in England renowned as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution in Britain
                    and ultimately Europe. The reason I’d like to visit Manchester is because it, is described as a
                    cultured and vibrant place. However the biggest incentive to visit Manchester is because it is home
                    to the most prestigious football club in the world Manchester United. I have support the club for as
                    long as I can remember and given the opportunity I’d like to immerse myself it that culture.

                I would like to learn Swahili because it is one of the oldest and most spoken languages in Africa.
                Furthermore Swahili literature rests on poetry and storytelling. While the oral traditions of Swahili
                continued well into the 17th century, the written literature of Swahili began in the 18th century. By
                studying these oral and written traditions, you deepen your understanding of language and gain insight
                into culture and gain a better understanding of the world.

            <p>
                The primary purpose of this module is to introduce the use of appropriate techniques, resources, and
                modern engineering tools, including information technology, prediction and modelling, for the solution
                of Quality Management Systems’ broadly defined engineering problems. More advanced problems and case
                studies are introduced to further develop problem solving and investigative skills. Thereafter they will
                learn how to set up a Quality Management System, analyse a process using statistical tools, carry out an
                Internal Quality Audit and improve a process using tools such as Brainstorming, Affinity Diagram, Cause
                and Effect Diagram, Matrix Diagram etc, as per the lecture / work schedule for this Module.

            <p>
                The purpose of this module is to be exposed to theoretical (conceptual) and practical (problem-solving)
                techniques used to handle operations management problem in industry and commerce for todays and future
                organisations.. The course pinpoints the need for an integrated framework that incorporates the design,
                organisation, planning, control and continuous improvement of all value-adding operations of any
                organisation. To achieve such a task, Operations Management techniques focuses on optimising all
                internal processes and resources in the context of resources constraints. The overriding aim is for the
                organisation to offer products or services that are cost competitive, of consistently high quality, and
                meet the dynamic delivery objectives of flexibility, dependability and speed. As a result, most of the
                Operations Management technique principles can be used in any organisation be it in private, public or
                not-for-profit sectors.
